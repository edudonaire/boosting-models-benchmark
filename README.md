# Boosting Models Benchmark (LightGBM × XGBoost × CatBoost)

This repository contains a reproducible machine learning benchmark comparing three leading gradient boosting algorithms:

- **LightGBM**
- **XGBoost**
- **CatBoost**

The evaluation includes:
- Standardized feature preprocessing  
- Unified train/validation splits  
- Reproducible pipelines  
- F1-score comparison  
- Training time analysis  
- Model interpretability (optional SHAP workflow)

This project is part of a broader ML governance and evaluation portfolio, demonstrating best practices for model assessment, consistency, and reliability.
